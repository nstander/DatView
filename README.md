# DatView
DatView displays plots of tabular data and syncs selections across plots. It was initially developed for serial crystallography data analysis with CrystFEL output files and includes a frame viewer for displaying 1D and 2D data from HDF5/CXI files.

DatView depends on matplotlib, PyQt (4 or 5 will work), NumPy, SciPy, lxml, h5py and pyqtgraph. Included with the code is a modified version of the CfelPyUtils geometry parser and the histogram clip function of cxiview.
